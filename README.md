Agent-Based Market Simulation (ABM)

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts that simulate a simplified financial market using agent-based modelling. The project examines how behavioural rules, risk preferences, noise, volatility, and market influence shape wealth distribution, price dynamics, and long-run inequality. Each script focuses on a single parameter and runs repeated simulations to measure its impact through summary statistics and error-bar visualisations.

The model consists of 10,000 heterogeneous agents whose initial wealth follows a heavy-tailed distribution with scale A = 1000 and tail parameter alpha = 2. Agents decide to open or close long or short positions based on momentum-driven signals, budget-dependent noise, and a per-step execution probability. Profit and loss thresholds provide basic risk management, while the Risk_fraction parameter determines how much of an agent’s budget can be deployed per trade. Some experiments split agents into low-risk and high-risk groups. Price evolves according to a Geometric Brownian Motion with drift mu and volatility sigma, optionally augmented by an influence term that reflects net trading direction.

Simulations record price paths, individual wealth trajectories, mean wealth, top/bottom deciles, and inequality metrics. Several scripts run multiple trials per parameter value and generate error-bar plots showing mean and standard deviation.

The script NMsim2_influencefactor1.m performs a single simulation including an influence term, saves summary metrics to simInfluence.xlsx, prints initial and final averages, and plots the price path. Noiseerrorbar.m varies noise from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1, runs 20 simulations per level, and produces error-bar plots showing how noise affects final average wealth. compare_risk_levels.m splits agents into low-risk and high-risk groups, varies volatility between 0.01 and 0.1, performs 10 runs per level, and plots comparative error bars for both groups’ final wealth. influence_errorbars.m varies influence strength from 0 to 2 in steps of 0.2, runs 10 simulations per value, and produces error-bar plots for final average wealth and final price.

The script mu_sigma_variation.m runs a grid of drift and volatility combinations, executes 10 simulations per pair, and visualises mean and standard deviation of final average wealth. risk_fraction_errorbars.m adjusts the Risk_fraction parameter from 0 to 1, runs 10 simulations per level, and plots total mean wealth along with top-10% and bottom-10% averages. top_bottom_sigma.m varies volatility from 0.01 to 0.1, tracks top and bottom deciles across 10 runs, and visualises inequality sensitivity to volatility. trade_probability_segmented_errorbars.m changes trade_prob from 0 to 1, performs 10 simulations per level, and plots error bars for total, top-decile, and bottom-decile mean wealth. wealth_inequality_10years.m extends the baseline model to a 10-year horizon (3,600 periods), repeats the simulation 10 times, records yearly wealth for the top and bottom deciles, and plots long-run inequality trends.

To run the model, simply open any script in MATLAB or Octave and execute it. Each script produces the relevant plots automatically, and some output additional summary files such as simInfluence.xlsx. Parameters, ranges, and run counts can be modified directly inside each file to explore alternative scenarios or extend the analysis.
